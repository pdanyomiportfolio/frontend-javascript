# üìò Introduction to TypeScript

This project is a practical introduction to **TypeScript**, a typed superset of JavaScript that helps developers write safer, more maintainable, and scalable code. The project covers TypeScript fundamentals, configuration, and its integration with real-world development workflows.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain (without Google):

1. **Basic Types in TypeScript**

   - Work with primitives (`string`, `number`, `boolean`), arrays, tuples, enums, and special types (`any`, `unknown`, `never`, `void`).

2. **Interfaces, Classes, and Functions**

   - Define and use interfaces.
   - Implement classes with properties, constructors, and methods.
   - Write typed functions with safe parameters and return values.

3. **Working with the DOM**

   - Select and manipulate DOM elements with type safety.
   - Handle events using proper type annotations.

4. **Generic Types**

   - Build reusable and flexible components/functions with `<T>`.
   - Apply constraints for stricter typing.

5. **Namespaces**

   - Organize and group related code with namespaces.
   - Prevent naming conflicts in large codebases.

6. **Declaration Merging**

   - Merge multiple declarations (interfaces/namespaces).
   - Extend existing ambient declarations.

7. **Ambient Namespaces (External Libraries)**

   - Use `declare` to describe external libraries without type definitions.
   - Safely integrate third-party libraries.

8. **Basic Nominal Typing**
   - Differentiate between structural and nominal typing...
   - Use branding techniques to simulate nominal typing...
